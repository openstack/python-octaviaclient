    Add support for setting Security Groups on VIP ports. ``--vip-sg-id
    <sg_id>`` can be passed (it can be provided more than once) to
    ``loadbalancer create`` and ``loadbalancer set``. A user can clear the
    Security Groups of a VIP port by passing ``--vip-sg-id`` to ``loadbalancer
    unset``.
