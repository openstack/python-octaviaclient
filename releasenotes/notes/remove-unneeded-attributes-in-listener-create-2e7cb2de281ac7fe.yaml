    Removed unneeded attributes that could have been passed to the API when
    calling "listener create", hsts_include_subdomains and hsts_preload were
    passed even when not used.
    It fixes an issue when using a recent python-octaviaclient release with
    older Octavia releases (without this HSTS feature).
